# React Authentication Sample
This project began as a course on React Authentication from Team Treehouse. It has been expanded with automated tests using React Testing Library + Jest.

The project contains two services. The API is a Node app that accepts registrations and authenticates login requests against those registrations. The client is a React app that demonstrates Sign Up, Sign In, and Sign Out functionality, and allows authenticated users to modify the settings of the app.
